            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt troubles moued in this realme by the D. of Guiſe, anno 1585. haue giuen ſufficient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a far other intent in him, then the ſame which he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therwith to abuſe the ouer great credulity of thoſe that are more readie to imbrace nouelties, then wiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what enſue. For hauing cloked his bad purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with Catholike religion and the rooting out of hereſie, all his exploites haue beene put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Catholike townes, euen in the beſt that he could ſeiſe vppon, to the end to beginne to lay ſure and firme foundations of his ſaid purpoſes, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie contriued long ſince for the atteining to the vſurpation of this crowne. By meanes hereof, ſo far is hereſie from weakening through his riſing, that contrariwiſe it is growne and waxen much ſtronger then before it was in this lande: and that the rather through his with drawing of a great part of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties forces and helpes, whereby he hath bin hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from working thoſe effects that are neceſſarie to the rooting out thereof: whereof the ſaide Duke hath beene the onely cauſe, who neuertheleſſe hath made himſelfe falſly to be proclaimed, <hi>The perſecuter of the not Catholike religion.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:20469:3"/>His maieſtie neuertheleſſe deſiring to reunite all his Catholike ſubiects, did by his firſt edict extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh this fault, vppon their goodly promiſes neuer to returne to the like: which notwithſtanding, his forces being occupied in the wars, as well in <hi>Guyen</hi> as in <hi>Prouence</hi> &amp; <hi>Daulphine,</hi> the ſaid D. yet ſeiſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other ſtrong holds, and ſpared no practiſes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes dayly to withdraw more out of his maieſties obedience.</p>
            <p>The ſeiſing vpon <hi>Paris,</hi> was the tipe of al miſchief: which notwithſtanding his Maieſtie purpoſing to eſchew all occaſion of warre among his ſaid Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſubiects, endeuoured alſo to bury this tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with a ſecond edict, and hoping to mollifie the hardneſſe of the ſaid D. of Guiſes heart, by fauours and courteſies beſtowed vpon him, ſo many as hee ſeemed any way to demand.</p>
            <p>But his ambition hauing a farther intent then to depend vppon any other, in lieu of acknowledging his dueties to his maieſtie, and conuerting the ſame to his ſervice, he vſed them as bridges to new pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes and attempts.</p>
            <p>He neuer left practiſing the good townes that yet remained ſtedfaſt in his maieſties obedience, and it may be ſaid, that in ſuch of them as he yet could not draw wholly to his ſide, the deuiſion was through the ſaide drifts ſo great, that the magiſtrates in the moſt part were not able any longer to reſtraine the inhabitants from murthering, &amp; cutting ech others throat.</p>
            <p>His partakers being detected of diuers heynous crime, were vnder his ſupport maintained in al free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20469:3"/>
ſo as the magiſtrates haue not beene able to miniſter iuſtice.</p>
            <p>The inſolencie as well of himſelfe as of his, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far, as to face, threaten, and terrifie thoſe that would not be other then his maieſties ſeruants, to the end to force them to abandon him, that they might afterward the more eaſelie vſe them at their pleaſures.</p>
            <p>In the aſſembly of the ſtates they ſpared no means through the miniſtery of diuers their partakers who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had practiſed throughout the prouinces, to let fall the elections, ſo to take away all authoritie and obedience from his Maieſtie, and make him odious to his ſubiects: whom they had ſtirred vp to make vnto him ſundry abſurd requeſtes, to the end by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning them to caſt downe the dignitie of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, or being refuſed, to take thereof a pretence to break off, and then to impute the cauſe to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and ſo bring him into hatred with his ſayde ſubiectes.</p>
            <p>His Maieſtie hath vſed all diſcretion poſſible, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo farre foorth, that he knewe himſelfe to haue encurred the contempt of his ſayde ſubiects, which was a great preparatiue to the ſayde duke of Guize to ſtrike his long forecaſt blowe: and indeede his Maieſtie hath receiued aduice from ſundrie places, euen from ſuch perſons as otherwiſe were affected to the ſaide duke of Guize, and yet abhorred his bad minde, that without ſpeedie regarde to his affayres he was in hazarde to looſe both crowne and life.</p>
